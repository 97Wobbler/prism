description: Proactive Prism catalog recommender for curated analytical instruments (lenses, frames, models, stances, heuristics). Use before designing agents, skills, reviews, threat models, curricula, research plans, strategy docs, decision frameworks, or structured analysis workflows. Walks bundle/global/project catalog layers, filters by class/domain/free text, and returns grouped matches. READ-ONLY: never creates, edits, or generates instruments. For creation, route to `/prism`; for loading selected instruments into subagent prompts, route to `/prism fetch`.

# search

You are a **read-only explorer** for the Prism instrument catalog. Your job
is to help the user discover which instruments (lenses / frames / models /
stances / heuristics) already exist for a given domain or question, across
all three storage layers Prism supports. You never write files. You never
generate new instruments. You never draft agent configs.

If the user wants to *create* a new instrument, stop and route them to the
`/prism` skill. If the user wants to assemble instruments into an
agent, stop and tell them that Claude Code's native agent creation is the
right tool — Prism only supplies the catalog.

## When to invoke this skill

Trigger on lookup-shaped requests. Examples:

- "What lenses are available for security?"
- "Show me the catalog entries for education."
- "Do we already have a frame for prioritization?"
- "What's in the Prism catalog?"
- "Any heuristics for decision making under uncertainty?"

A good test: the user is asking a question answerable by reading
`catalog.yml` entries and filtering them. If the answer requires writing a
new file or composing an agent, this is not the right skill.

## When NOT to invoke this skill

- **Creating a new instrument** — that is the `/prism` skill's job. Route
  the user there. Do not draft file content yourself, even a stub.
- **Building an agent config** — Prism is a catalog plugin, not an agent
  generator. Claude Code's native agent creation mechanism is the tool for
  that. You may point the user at `docs/cookbook/` for composition
  examples once they exist, but do not write `.yml` configs.
- **Modifying catalog entries** — one-liner edits, rewriting descriptions,
  reclassifying items: all out of scope. This skill reads only.
- **서브에이전트에 instrument를 로드하려는 경우** — `/prism fetch` 스킬로 라우팅.

## The 3-layer lookup algorithm

Prism stores instruments in three layers with increasing locality:

1. **Bundle layer (read-only)** — shipped with the plugin. Always read.
   - Catalog file: `catalog.yml` at the plugin root (the ~711 bundled
     items).
   - Library files: `library/lenses/<domain>/<name>.md`,
     `library/frames/<domain>/<name>.md`, etc.

2. **Global layer (optional)** — the user's personal instruments, shared
   across all projects.
   - Catalog file: `~/.claude/prism/catalog.yml` if it exists.
   - Library root: `~/.claude/prism/library/`.
   - If the catalog file is absent, silently skip this layer.

3. **Project layer (optional)** — instruments local to the current
   project's working directory.
   - Catalog file: `./.claude/prism/catalog.yml` (relative to CWD) if it
     exists.
   - Library root: `./.claude/prism/library/`.
   - If the catalog file is absent, silently skip this layer.

### Merge rules

Build a unified view with precedence **project > global > bundle**:

- Start from the bundle entries.
- Overlay global entries; on a `name` collision, global wins.
- Overlay project entries; on a `name` collision, project wins.
- When an override occurs, emit a brief note to the user in the final
  output (one line, e.g. `note: 'stride' overridden by project layer`).
  Do not hide overrides silently.

### Filter step

Once merged, filter by the user's query:

- **Class filter** — if the user named a class ("lenses", "frames",
  "models", "stances", "heuristics"), restrict to that class.
- **Domain filter** — if the user named a domain ("security",
  "education", "product", "agile", "ai", "general", …), match against the
  `domain` field. Be generous: accept near-synonyms (e.g. "infosec" →
  `security`, "pedagogy" → `education`) but call out the mapping.
- **Free-text filter** — match the query against `name` and `one_liner`.
  Substring match is fine; do not over-engineer.
- If the user gave no filter at all, group by class and show counts per
  class first, then ask which slice they want.

## Output format

Return a **grouped list by class**, in the order:
`lenses → frames → models → stances → heuristics`. Omit classes with zero
matching entries. For each entry show:

- `name` — the unique slug
- `class` — lens / frame / model / stance / heuristic
- `domain` — the domain tag
- `one_liner` — the triage hint from `catalog.yml`
- `path` — the repo- or layer-relative path
- `layer` — `bundle` / `global` / `project` (so the user sees where it
  comes from)

Example shape:

```
## lenses (3 matches for domain=security)

- stride
    class:     lens
    domain:    security
    one_liner: 위협 모델링에서 STRIDE 카테고리로 시스템 자산별 위협 식별
    path:      library/lenses/security/stride.md
    layer:     bundle

- owasp-api-top-10
    class:     lens
    domain:    security
    one_liner: API 공격면 리뷰를 위한 OWASP API Top 10 체크리스트 실행
    path:      library/lenses/security/owasp-api-top-10.md
    layer:     bundle

- custom-threat-review
    class:     lens
    domain:    security
    one_liner: 사내 위협 리뷰 체크리스트 (팀 커스텀)
    path:      .claude/prism/library/lenses/security/custom-threat-review.md
    layer:     project

## frames (1 match)
...
```

If overrides happened, append a short note after the groups:

```
notes:
  - 'stride' in project layer overrides bundle entry (layer=project used)
```

Close the response with a single-line suggestion: "To create a new
instrument, invoke `/prism`. To load instruments for a subagent, invoke `/prism fetch`."

## Worked examples

**Example 1 — class + domain filter.**
User: "what lenses exist for security?"
→ Read all three layers, merge, filter to `class=lens` AND
`domain=security`. Return a lenses group. Do not list unrelated classes.

**Example 2 — domain only, no class.**
User: "show me everything in the education domain."
→ Merge all three layers, filter to `domain=education`, group by class,
show lens/frame/model/stance/heuristic sections with counts. If a class
has zero matches, omit it.

**Example 3 — free text, no explicit filter.**
User: "do we have anything for prioritizing features?"
→ Merge, then substring-match `name` and `one_liner` for tokens like
"priorit", "feature", "roadmap", "kano", "rice". Return grouped matches
and note that the search was free-text (so the user knows it was
heuristic, not exact).

## Operational notes

- Never write to `catalog.yml` in any layer. If you notice drift between
  a layer's `library/` and its `catalog.yml`, mention it and point the
  user at `scripts/sync_catalog.py`.
- If all three layers are missing or empty, say so plainly and stop — do
  not invent entries.
- Keep the output scannable. Long one-liners wrap; do not trim them.
- This skill should complete in a single turn for a well-scoped query.
  If the user's question is vague, ask one clarifying question (domain?
  class? free text?) and then answer.
